    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        At MindWell, our mission is to promote mental health awareness, reduce stigma, and provide resources and support to those experiencing mental health challenges. We believe that mental well-being is just as important as physical health, and everyone deserves access to help, hope, and healing.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
        We envision a world where mental health is prioritized, openly discussed, and supported. A world where no one feels alone in their struggles, and everyone has access to compassionate care and community.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
        We offer a wide range of services and resources, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Educational articles and expert insights</li>
            <li>Guided self-help tools and coping strategies</li>
            <li>Online support groups and forums</li>
            <li>Referrals to licensed mental health professionals</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
        One in four people will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. Despite this, stigma and misinformation remain major barriers to treatment. MindWell is committed to changing that through education, advocacy, and support.
